### Notes

- Maintain backward compatibility with existing SimSelector functionality
- Implement comprehensive error handling to prevent device failures during critical installations
- Follow security best practices with proper access controls and firewall management
- Include extensive unit testing covering all scenarios including edge cases and error conditions
- Use responsive web design for dashboard accessibility on mobile devices and tablets
- Implement proper logging and monitoring for troubleshooting and support

### **CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT BEST PRACTICES:**

**üîÑ Continuous Integration Protocol:**
- **After each sub-task completion:** Run unit tests, update documentation, commit changes
- **After each major task:** Update CHANGELOG.md, run security audit, validate backward compatibility
- **Before each commit:** Run existing tests to ensure no regressions
- **Security validation:** Check for exposed credentials, validate firewall rules, audit access controls

**üìù Documentation Updates:**
- Update README.md after implementing new features
- Update CHANGELOG.md with each significant change
- Commit documentation changes with code changes
- Validate all documentation links and examples

**üîí Security Maintenance:**
- Validate no sensitive data in commits before pushing
- Run security checks after each major change
- Ensure firewall rules are properly managed
- Audit access controls and permissions

**‚ö° Rapid Development Protocol:**
- Focus on core functionality first, then enhancements
- Implement with working increments - test early and often
- Prioritize business-critical features
- Maintain working state at all times - no broken builds
