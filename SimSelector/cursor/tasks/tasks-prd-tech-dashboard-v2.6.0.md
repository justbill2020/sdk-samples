### **CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT BEST PRACTICES:**

**🔄 Continuous Integration Protocol:**
- **After each sub-task completion:** Run unit tests, update documentation, commit changes
- **After each major task:** Update CHANGELOG.md, run security audit, validate backward compatibility
- **Before each commit:** Run existing tests to ensure no regressions
- **Security validation:** Check for exposed credentials, validate firewall rules, audit access controls

**📝 Documentation Updates:**
- Update README.md after implementing new features
- Update CHANGELOG.md with each significant change
- Commit documentation changes with code changes
- Validate all documentation links and examples

**🔒 Security Maintenance:**
- Validate no sensitive data in commits before pushing
- Run security checks after each major change
- Ensure firewall rules are properly managed
- Audit access controls and permissions

**⚡ Rapid Development Protocol:**
- Focus on core functionality first, then enhancements
- Implement with working increments - test early and often
- Prioritize business-critical features
- Maintain working state at all times - no broken builds
