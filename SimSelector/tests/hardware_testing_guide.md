# SimSelector Hardware Testing Guide

**Safe & Systematic Testing on Real Cradlepoint Hardware**

## üéØ Overview

This guide provides a systematic approach to validate SimSelector 2.5.9 on actual Cradlepoint hardware after comprehensive mock testing. It includes staging procedures, monitoring tools, and safety protocols to ensure reliable deployment.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements
- **Cradlepoint Router**: Any NCOS-compatible device (IBR1700, IBR900, etc.)
- **SIM Cards**: Minimum 2 active SIMs with data plans
- **Antennas**: Properly connected cellular antennas
- **Network**: Stable management network connection

### Software Requirements
- **NCM Access**: Active NetCloud Manager account with device access
- **SSH/Console**: Direct device access for troubleshooting
- **Monitoring Tools**: Log collection and analysis capability

### Pre-Testing Validation
```bash
# Run all mock tests first
python tests/test_runner.py all

# Validate mock data accuracy
python tests/mock_data_validator.py --all
```

## üîß Staged Testing Approach

### Stage 1: Lab Environment Testing
**Goal**: Validate basic functionality in controlled environment

#### Setup
1. **Controlled Network**: Test in lab with known good connectivity
2. **Backup Configuration**: Save current router configuration
3. **Monitoring**: Set up continuous log monitoring
4. **SIM Cards**: Use test SIMs with adequate data allowances

#### Test Procedure
```bash
# 1. Deploy application to test device
# Upload SimSelector package via NCM

# 2. Enable detailed logging
# Router CLI: config system logging level debug

# 3. Monitor initial boot cycle
# NCM: Monitor > Logs > Application Logs

# 4. Trigger validation phase manually
# NCM: Set device description to "start"

# 5. Monitor validation results
# Look for staging feedback in description field
```

#### Expected Results
- ‚úÖ SIM detection within 30 seconds
- ‚úÖ Staging feedback appears in description field
- ‚úÖ Signal quality classification accurate
- ‚úÖ No application crashes or timeouts

### Stage 2: Signal Quality Validation
**Goal**: Verify signal strength measurements and classifications

#### Test Matrix
| Test Case | RSRP Range | Expected Classification | Test Method |
|-----------|------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Excellent Signal | -50 to -70 dBm | Good Signal | Close to tower |
| Good Signal | -70 to -90 dBm | Good Signal | Normal distance |
| Weak Signal | -90 to -105 dBm | Weak Signal | Far from tower |
| Bad Signal | < -105 dBm | Bad Signal (Check Antenna) | Antenna disconnected |

#### Validation Commands
```bash
# Check actual RSRP values via CLI
status cellular module mdm-sim1 diagnostics

# Compare with SimSelector classification
# Check device description field for staging results
```

### Stage 3: Speed Test Validation
**Goal**: Verify Ookla speed test integration and accuracy

#### Pre-Test Checks
- ‚úÖ Internet connectivity on each SIM
- ‚úÖ Adequate data allowances (>1GB per SIM)
- ‚úÖ Speedtest.net accessibility
- ‚úÖ No data throttling or carrier restrictions

#### Speed Test Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor speed test progress
tail -f /var/log/application.log | grep SimSelector

# Check for timeout errors
grep "timeout" /var/log/application.log

# Verify speed test results
# Compare with manual speed tests using speedtest-cli
```

#### Validation Criteria
- **Download Speeds**: Within 20% of manual speed tests
- **Upload Speeds**: Within 30% of manual speed tests (more variable)
- **Test Duration**: Complete within 5 minutes per SIM
- **No Timeouts**: All tests should complete successfully

### Stage 4: Performance Phase Testing
**Goal**: Validate comprehensive testing and SIM prioritization

#### Test Scenarios
1. **Normal Performance**: All SIMs meet minimum thresholds
2. **Below Minimums**: Some SIMs below 5G/LTE thresholds
3. **Mixed Technologies**: 5G and LTE SIMs together
4. **Similar Speeds**: Test tie-breaking logic

#### Monitoring Points
```bash
# Watch for phase transitions
grep "phase" /var/log/application.log

# Monitor SIM prioritization
grep "Prioritizing SIMs" /var/log/application.log

# Check WAN rule configuration
status wan rules2
```

### Stage 5: Field Testing
**Goal**: Validate in real deployment conditions

#### Deployment Conditions
- **Remote Locations**: Test with varying signal conditions
- **Multiple Carriers**: Use SIMs from different operators
- **Production Traffic**: Monitor with real user traffic
- **Extended Duration**: Run for multiple days

#### Safety Protocols
1. **Rollback Plan**: Keep original configuration backup
2. **Remote Access**: Ensure out-of-band management access
3. **Monitoring**: Continuous health monitoring
4. **Support Contact**: 24/7 support availability during testing

## üìä Testing Tools & Scripts

### Real-Time Monitoring Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# monitor_simselector.sh - Real-time SimSelector monitoring

echo "üîç SimSelector Hardware Testing Monitor"
echo "======================================"

while true; do
    echo -n "$(date '+%H:%M:%S') - "
