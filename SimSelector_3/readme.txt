Application Purpose
===================
“SimSelector” is a SIM Speedtest app designed to test TCP throughput on multiple SIMs, supporting multiple modems, and prioritize them based on download speed, including the following configurable options:

•	MIN_DOWNLOAD_SPD – If no SIM download speed meets minimum, a FAILURE report is sent.  SIMs are still prioritized and slowest SIMs are disabled according to NUM_ACTIVE_SIMS.
Default Value = 0.0
•	MIN_UPLOAD_SPD – If no SIM upload speed meets minimum, a FAILURE report is sent.  SIMs are still prioritized and slowest SIMs are disabled according to NUM_ACTIVE_SIMS
Default Value = 0.0
•	SCHEDULE – Minutes between runs. 0=Only run at boot; 60=hourly; 1440=daily
Default Value = 0
•	NUM_ACTIVE_SIMS – Number of fastest SIMs to keep active. 0=all; do not disable any SIMs.
Default Value = 0
•	ONLY_RUN_ONCE – True means do not run if Boot2 has run on this device before. (common for install usage).
Default Value = False

Expected Output
===============
SimSelector will perform a netperf speedtest on all SIMs and prioritize by TCP download speed.  It does not delete WAN profiles, but will clone profiles if multiple SIMs match a profile.

SimSelector will send custom NCM alerts when it starts, when a SIM test times out, and when it completes.

Results will be put into the description field to sync to devices grid in NCM.
